What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    What happens is that git adds a ".git" hidden directory to the directory you're in
    Then it starts tracking everything you do in that directory so you can make commits.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area tells git what to put into the repository from the working directory. It offers value because it makes it easier to
    specify exactly what you want included in the next commit.

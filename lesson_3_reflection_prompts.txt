When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    To keep backups of your work or to share your work with others
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Honestly, it seems like a bad idea to me - doing that is just asking for your local
    and remote repositories to get out of sync.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Fork is only for taking someone else's work on Github, copying it, then making your own changes. A clone is
    when you copy a repository from Github to your local machine, or within a local machine. A branch is when you
    are working on a repository but want to try some changes without impacting the main code. I think you could
    use a local clone like a branch, but then you'd have two totally separate repositories and lose the ability
    to merge.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    It will allow you to know if anything has been done by anyone else in the meantime.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    I would try to create a similar system using Google Drive or a comparable system. It would be difficult
    since things are not tracked with as much detail, but it would be easier since I wouldn't have to use the
    command line or remember the commands and idiosyncrasies of Git and GitHub.

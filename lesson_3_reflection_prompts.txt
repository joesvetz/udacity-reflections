When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    To keep backups of your work or to share your work with others
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Honestly, it seems like a bad idea to me - doing that is just asking for your local
    and remote repositories to get out of sync.
